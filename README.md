# Hello-World
I am new to the coding world and work with a company that utilizes coding to enhance the techonology skills of young people with cognitive impairments.
As a part of that journey, we are trying to identify helpful formats to challenge and teach these kids some fun, new skills.  I appreciate all of the great resources and am excited to work within GitHub!
